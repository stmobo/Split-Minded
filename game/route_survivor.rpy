    "And that's how the Survivor seized the controls from me."

    surv "Hah! Who's a mental construct {i}now{/i}, Pyro?"

    pyro "All of us, last I checked."

    surv "Well, fuck you anyways! I'm taking control now, and I think we should...{w} go recon."

    surv "And wait, how are you still around, anyways?"

    pyro "As I said: I don't think we can truly die. We just fade, for a moment."

    calm "...so we have an opportunity to take control again."

    pyro "Precisely.{p}Though I'd be damned if I let myself lose twice to you lot."
